1.What is a Node module? 
Answer: essentially the equivalent as a JS library, it's a set of functions you want to use in your application.

2.What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?
Answer: exports is a reference to module.exports and cannot reassign the object module.exports. If you want your module to be a specific object type, use module.exports.

3.Why is using exports recommended?
Answer: It's recommended unless you are planning on having your module be a specific object type, as exports alone is not for a specific object type and will not overwrite module.exports with assignment operations which could then no longer be invoked. 

Programming Questions
Before you begin, make sure you have greeting.js and main.js in the following states:

greeting.js
exports.greetingEnglish = function(){
 console.log("Hello");
}

exports.greetingJapanese = function(){
 console.log("Konichiwa");
}
main.js
const greetings = require("./greeting.js");

// "Hello"
greetings.greetingEnglish();

// "Konichiwa"
greetings.greetingJapanese();
Add two more functions, greetingSpanish and greetingIcelandic, in greeting.js.
Utilize the two functions in main.js just like greetingEnglish and greetingJapanese.
Create another Node module and import it into main.js. Your Node module should have at least two functions within it. Then, call a function from your Node module in main.js.
